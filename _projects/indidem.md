# indidem

## The goal of the indidem project was to develop a single, snapshot view of one researcher's life's work, in preparation for their 90th birthday celebration.

The records collected for use in this project were thankfully already in a database, but it had data entry issues and was itself the culmination of several failed databases of different specifications, so a months of cleaning and standardisation were needed before analysis could begin.
