      "content": "The goal of the indidem project was to develop a single, snapshot view of one researcher’s life’s work, for presentation at their 90th birthday celebration.\n\nThat life’s work was family history research, and over 30 years of effort had resulted in an impressive collection that was not only deep but broad: it progressed back in time but also gathered and connected all members of families and splinter groups. Consequently the name chosen for the project was indidem, a Latin word meaning from the same place or source.\n\nThe data made available for this project was thankfully already digital and in a database. However, that database was itself the culmination of several other obsolete or failed databases. So, there were data entry issues and inconsistencies, and months of cleaning and standardisation were needed before analysis could begin.\n\nThe single, snapshot view of the data (the ‘map’) was produced with the aid of the Australian platform Polinode. The map is a type called an actor-network diagram. Actor-network diagrams are often used in social network analysis and are based on the actor-network theory of academic sociology. In these diagrams a set of people (actors) are displayed as a group, which is organised according to how they connect or relate to each other (in a network). The actor-network format was chosen instead of the traditional family tree or pedigree chart because trees tend to emphasise horizontal sibling relationships, and as a result, ‘go wide’ very quickly. In this case, with so many thousands of people involved, a traditional tree would be huge and unreadable. As far as we know, using an actor-network diagram to display family history research is a first.\n\nThe infographic style poster was created as a display and conversation starter for the 90th birthday celebration. The left hand side of the poster shows a few key statistics drawn from the database, while most of the poster displays a version of the Polinode map. The statistics detail the total population and total number of families identified, plus provide a gender breakdown, an age-group focussed population pyramid also separated by gender, and subtotals for each century from the 1500s to 2000s. A list of people who were significant for bringing a number of key families or ‘clans’ together completes the sidebar panel; the numbers beside each person correspond to numbers present on the map. Finally, below the map itself is a breakdown of the family names present in each ‘clan’.\n",
